About this notebook - Lancelot Pr√©gniard

This notebook reports my work on a modeling exercise as part of the Dataiku recruiting process for a Data Scientist internship in London.

The goal of the exercise is to model the annual wage of a citizen (as a binary variable : +/- 50k$) from 41 features, based on a US Census dataset.
